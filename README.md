## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Automate-Certificates.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Automate-Certificates
    ```

3. Install the required Python libraries. You should have a `requirements.txt` file in your project directory. If you do, run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you'll need to install the necessary libraries manually. For example, if your project uses `numpy` and `pandas`, you would do:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas
    ```
